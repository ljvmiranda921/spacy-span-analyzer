title: "Reproducibility Study for Span Type Characteristics"
description: |
  This project aims to reproduce some of the metrics reported by the paper,
  *Dissecting Span Identification Tasks with Performance Prediction* (Papay, et
  *al, 2020) with a few additions:

  - New datasets on Nested NER, particularly GENIA and the Shared BioNLP task.
    The GENIA dataset is sourced from the parsed IOB version in the source repository
    of *A Boundary-aware Neural Model for Nested Named Entity Recognition* (Zheng, et al 2019).
  - I will also be adding a few more datasets such as the Healthsea dataset, the
    EBM-NLP corpus, and the ToxicSpans dataset.

# These are the directories that the project needs. The project CLI will make
# sure that they always exist.
directories: ["assets", "corpus", "scripts", "metrics"]

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  analyze-all:
    - riqua
    - conll2000
    - conll2003

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
