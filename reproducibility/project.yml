title: "Reproducibility Study for Span Type Characteristics"
description: |
  This project aims to reproduce some of the metrics reported by the paper,
  *Dissecting Span Identification Tasks with Performance Prediction* (Papay, et
  *al, 2020) with a few changes:

  - I will only reproduce the span characteristics (length, distinctiveness,
    etc.) to check if the span analyzer is working as intended.
  - I will add a few datasets to increase the breadth of this study. In particular, I'll
    be checking some of the nested NER datasets from Yu, et al's work (2020) on
    *Named Entity Recognition as Dependency Parsing*.

# These are the directories that the project needs. The project CLI will make
# sure that they always exist.
directories: ["assets", "corpus", "scripts"]

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.
workflows:
  analyze-all:
    - riqua
    - conll2000
    - conll2003

# Project commands, specified in a style similar to CI config files (e.g. Azure
# pipelines). The name is the command name that lets you trigger the command
# via "spacy project run [command] [path]". The help message is optional and
# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
