title: "Reproducibility Study for Span Type Characteristics"
description: |
  This project aims to reproduce some of the metrics reported by the paper,
  *Dissecting Span Identification Tasks with Performance Prediction* (Papay, et
  *al, 2020) with a few changes:

  - I will only reproduce the span characteristics (length, distinctiveness,
    etc.) to check if the span analyzer is working as intended.
  - I will add a few datasets to increase the breadth of this study. In particular, I'll
    be checking some of the nested NER datasets from Yu, et al's work (2020) on
    *Named Entity Recognition as Dependency Parsing*.

# Workflows are sequences of commands (see below) executed in order. You can
# run them via "spacy project run [workflow]". If a commands's inputs/outputs
# haven't changed, it won't be re-run.

# shown when executing "spacy project run [optional command] [path] --help".
