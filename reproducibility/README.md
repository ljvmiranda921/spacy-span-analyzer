# ü™ê spaCy Project: Reproducibility Study for Span Type Characteristics

This project aims to reproduce some of the metrics reported by the paper,
*Dissecting Span Identification Tasks with Performance Prediction* (Papay, et
*al, 2020) with a few changes:

- I will only reproduce the span characteristics (length, distinctiveness,
  etc.) to check if the span analyzer is working as intended.
- I will add a few datasets to increase the breadth of this study. In particular, I'll
  be checking some of the nested NER datasets from Yu, et al's work (2020) on
  *Named Entity Recognition as Dependency Parsing*.


## üìã project.yml

The [`project.yml`](project.yml) defines the data assets required by the
project, as well as the available commands and workflows. For details, see the
[spaCy projects documentation](https://spacy.io/usage/projects).

### ‚èØ Commands

The following commands are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run).
Commands are only re-run if their inputs have changed.

| Command | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `install` | Install dependencies |
| `riqua` | Parse and analyze the RiQuA (Rich Quotation Analysis) quotation dataset into the spaCy format. |
| `conll2000` | Parse the ConLL 2003 English dataset into the spaCy format (using Spans). |
| `conll2003` | Parse and analyze the ConLL 2003 English dataset into the spaCy format (using Spans). |

### ‚è≠ Workflows

The following workflows are defined by the project. They
can be executed using [`spacy project run [name]`](https://spacy.io/api/cli#project-run)
and will run the specified commands in order. Commands are only re-run if their
inputs have changed.

| Workflow | Steps |
| --- | --- |
| `analyze-all` | `riqua` &rarr; `conll2000` &rarr; `conll2003` |
